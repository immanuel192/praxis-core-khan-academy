## What is implied?

Some questions on test will ask you to make an **inference** based on information in the passage. The answer may not be explicitly stated in the passage—you’re being tested on your ability to "connect the dots" and determine what is **implied**.

### Examples:

- "The passage suggests which of the following statements about <u>___</u>?
- "The author of the passage implies that <u>___</u> was effective because..."

## Strategies

- Use **process of elimination** to get rid of inferences that can’t be supported: eventually you'll find one that is!

- **Don’t get thrown by the word “inference.”** On many inference questions, you’ll find all the support you need for the answer in one part of the passage. The correct option might not do much more than restate an idea that is fairly explicit in the passage—the "inference" is often barely under the surface. The answer is always the choice that has the most support in the passage; it **won’t** be a choice that requires you to use your imagination.

### Common wrong choice types:

Here are two tempting wrong choice types you might encounter:

- **Out of scope:** Sometimes a choice will bring up a topic that is only *partially*related to the topics in the passage. These choices can be quite attractive because they *sound* like they’re an extension of the point the author is making. However, they **go beyond** what can reasonably be inferred from the statements in the passage itself.
- **Too strong or extreme:** Some incorrect choices will reflect a basic idea expressed in the passage, but take it further than can be supported by the text. Be wary of “extreme” words like *always, all, every* or *never*.

#### Your turn!

**Practice these strategies with the example below!**

EXAMPLE

Histories of the Middle East abound in stereotypes and clichés, particularly with respect to women. The position of women in the Middle East is frequently treated as though Middle Eastern societies formed a single unit that could be accurately represented in a simple description.

The author of the passage suggests which of the following about histories of the Middle East with regard to their treatment of women?

Choose 1 answer:

- (Choice A)   A general problem with such histories was first noticed in their descriptions of the role of women.

- (Choice B)   The experience of women in Middle Eastern societies is much more diverse than such histories have assumed.

- (Choice C)   The study of women's roles and experience has recently become a central focus in such histories.

- (Choice D)   Such histories report that the position of women in Middle Eastern societies has undergone a major transformation.

- (Choice E)    Until recently, such histories typically neglected to discuss the position of women.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The correct answer is B

  Explain in detail 

- Choice A: This is *outside* the scope of the passage. The author doesn't mention anything about how the problem with these histories was "first noticed".

- Choice B: This is the best choice. The author speaks negatively of these histories, stating that they're based on stereotypes. Specifically, the author criticizes the view that women from all Middle Eastern societies share a single role that can be easily described. This criticism implies the author believes the opposite: on the contrary, women's roles in the Middle East are numerous and complex.

- Choice C: This isn't supported. The author criticizes how these histories view the roles and experiences of women. They don't suggest there has been a recent change in this tendency.

- Choice D: This isn't supported. The author doesn't suggest that women's roles have *changed*. Instead, they suggest that women in Middle Eastern societies have many roles, and shouldn't be broadly stereotyped.

- Choice E: This is too *extreme* to be supported by the passage. While the author complains that these histories have characterized women too broadly and simply, they don't suggest the histories neglected to discuss women *entirely*. Also notice that the passage doesn't suggest any "recent" change in these histories.
