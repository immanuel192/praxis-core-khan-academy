## What else is likely to be true?

These questions will ask you to **draw conclusions** from information included in the passage.

### Examples

- "Which of the following statements about ___ is best supported by the information provided?"
- "The author of the passage would most likely draw which conclusion about ___?"

## Strategies

- **Put it in your own words:** Often you will be asked to draw a conclusion from a specific idea contained in the passage. It can be helpful to sum up the idea in your own words *before* considering the choices.

- Use **process of elimination** to get rid of conclusions that can’t be supported, until you find one that is.

## Common Wrong Choice Types

- **Too strong or extreme:** Some incorrect choices will sound like a reasonable conclusion, but take it further than can be supported by the passage. Be wary of “extreme,” all-encompassing words like **always, all, every** or **never**.

- **Out of Scope:** Some choices may include a reasonable conclusion only tangentially related to the idea in the passage. **Remember** the conclusion you're drawing must be supported by information *in the text*.

## Your turn!

**Practice these strategies with the example below!**

EXAMPLE

Scientists consider both landslides and surface-creep movement essential in the formation of rock glaciers. Evidence of landslides can be distinguished from that of surface-creep movement because landslides leave a deeper and more definite surface of rupture, partly due to their faster rate of movement. Those studying the origins of rock glaciers have noted that some glaciers are well-defined, while others are not; that is, some show evidence of deep ruptures, while others do not.

Given the information in the passage, which of the following may be concluded about rock glaciers?

Choose 1 answer:

- (Choice A)   Not all rock glaciers originate in the same way.

- (Choice B)   Landslides initiate the formation of rock glaciers, then surface-creep movement follows.

- (Choice C)   Neither landslides nor surface-creep movement account for the formation of rock glaciers.

- (Choice D)   While the definition and depth of rupture can be measured at rock glacier sites, the rate of movement cannot.

- (Choice E)   Further study is required to determine the origins of rock glaciers.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The correct answer is A

  Explain in detail 

- Choice A: This is the best choice. According to the passage, some rock glaciers show deep ruptures, while others don't. Since deep ruptures are a sign of landslide formation, it logically follows that some glaciers originate from landslides, while others don't.
- Choice B: This isn't a conclusion we can draw. The passage doesn't indicate if both landslides and surface-creep play a part in the formation of all rock glaciers. The passage also doesn't suggest landslides come before surface-creep.
- Choice C: This isn't a conclusion we can draw. The passage states that "scientists consider both landslides and surface-creep movement essential in the formation of rock glaciers."
- Choice D: This isn't a conclusion we can draw. The passage doesn't indicate whether or not rate of movement can be measured at rock glacier sites.
- Choice E: This isn't a conclusion we can draw. The passage provides substantial insight into the origins of rock glaciers and makes no recommendations for further study.
