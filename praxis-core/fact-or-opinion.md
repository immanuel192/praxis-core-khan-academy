## Is this supported by facts?

A few questions will ask you to determine whether information presented in a reading selection **fact or opinion**. 



### Examples

- "The author of the passage expresses an opinion about which of the following?"
- "Which of the following sentences from the passage contains an expression of the author’s opinion?"



## Strategies

- **Locate emotion words:** Is there a point where the author uses emotionally charged words to describe something? Do they characterize something as very negative or very positive? If so, there's a good chance the author is expressing an **opinion**.

- **Says who?** Each time a statement is made or a conclusion is drawn, ask yourself "says who?" To be *facts*, claims need to be supported by **evidence and logic**, not just the perspective of the author.



## Your turn!

**Practice these strategies with the example below!**

EXAMPLE

William Bailey, an American Realist painter, studied at Yale in the 1950s. His still lifes depict smooth, rounded containers that sit in a field of uniform color. Bailey denies a close connection to Giorgio Morandi, an Italian painter of still lifes, but admits that they share "a belief in the power of the mute object." While Morandi painted from direct observation, Bailey painted from memory. This difference in method makes Bailey's objects superior to Morandi's, for they are thus purified, immutable, and mysterious.

- (Choice C)   Bailey denies a close connection to Giorgio Morandi, an Italian painter of still lifes, but admits that they share "a belief in the power of the mute object."

- (Choice D)   While Morandi painted from direct observation, Bailey painted from memory.

- (Choice E)   This difference in method makes Bailey's objects superior to Morandi's, for they are thus purified, immutable, and mysterious.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The correct answer is E

  Explain in detail 

- Choice A: This isn't an opinion. This is a verifiable fact about Bailey's life.
- Choice B: This isn't an opinion. This is a verifiable fact about the subjects of Bailey's paintings.
- Choice C: This isn't an opinion. While this sentence contains Bailey's opinion, the sentence itself is a fact. It is verifiably true that Bailey "denies a close connection to" Morandi.
- Choice D: This isn't an opinion. This is a factual observation about the painting processes of these two painters.
- Choice E: This is the best choice. There is no verifiable evidence that Bailey's artwork is objectively "superior to" Morandi's artwork. This is an expression of the author's personal preference, and as such is an opinion.
