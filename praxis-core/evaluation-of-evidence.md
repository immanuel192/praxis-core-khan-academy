## What strengthens or weakens this position?

**Evaluation of Evidence** questions ask you to determine whether evidence **strengthens, weakens**, or is **relevant** to the arguments in a reading passage.

### Examples

- "Which of the following, if true, would most clearly strengthen/weaken the idea that ___?"
- "The passage provides information for answering most fully which of the following questions?"

## 

## Strategies

**Put it in your own words:** It can be helpful to sum up in your own words the idea that you’re trying to strengthen or weaken *before* considering the choices. 

**It’s not enough to be *about* the same topic:** Keep in mind that what you’re looking for is information that **changes** the plausibility of the position the question is asking about. It isn’t enough that a piece of information in a choice is *about* something that the passage or question is concerned with. The correct choice must have a **real impact on the strength of the claim**.

**Proof isn’t required:** The answers to these questions **don’t** have to conclusively prove or definitively refute the claim being asked about. 

## Tempting wrong choice types

- **Supports rather than weakens, or vice versa:** Make sure to pay attention to whether the question is asking for strengthening or weakening evidence. There’s almost always a wrong choice that does the **opposite** of what you’re being asked to do!
- **No impact:** Most other wrong choices will either be unrelated to the claim (and thus have no impact), or they’ll be on the same topic but won’t affect the strength of the claim in any way.
- **Out of scope:** When asked what question a passage most fully answers, a common wrong choice will be a question related to the passage, and to which you may know the answer. **Remember** the question must be answered *directly* by information in the text.

#### Your turn!

**Practice these strategies with the example below!**

EXAMPLE

In our increasing awareness of ecological health, many industrial practices have come under close examination, and mining is no exception. Though drilling is required in both cases, base-metal mining involves toxic chemical leachates for separating the metal from the rock, whereas diamond mining does not—diamonds can be separated from surrounding rock using only crushers, screens, and all-natural water. Thus, base-metal mining is environmentally destructive, but diamond mining does not harm the environment.

Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the author's argument concerning the effect of diamond mining on the environment?

Choose 1 answer:

- (Choice A)   The process of drilling and getting the drill rig to and from the site destroys ecological habitats.

- (Choice B)   Base metals have utilitarian value, but diamonds are functionally almost worthless.

- (Choice C)   Toxic chemical leachates contaminate not only soil, but groundwater as well.

- (Choice D)   There have been proposals to use abandoned mine shafts as garbage dumps.

- (Choice E)   Logging can be as ecologically destructive as mining.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The correct answer is A

  Explain in detail 

- Choice A: This is the best choice. The author argues that diamond mining doesn't harm the environment because it doesn't use chemical leachates. However, this choice states that diamond mining still harms the environment in *other ways*.
- Choice B: This doesn't weaken the author's argument. The functional worth of diamonds doesn't change how diamond mining impacts the environment.
- Choice C: This doesn't weaken the author's argument about diamond mining. According to the passage, diamond mining *doesn't* use chemical leachates.
- Choice D: This doesn't weaken the author's argument about diamond mining. What is done with abandoned mine shafts doesn't impact the environmental effects of the actual mining process.
- Choice E: This doesn't weaken the author's argument about diamond mining. The ecological impact of logging is irrelevant to the discussion of diamond mining.
