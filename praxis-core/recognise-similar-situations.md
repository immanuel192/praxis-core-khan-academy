## Which scenario matches the idea in the passage?

These questions will direct you to something specific in the text and ask you to find something similar to it among the choices. 

The subject matter of the choices may be different from that of the passage, but don't let that distract you. You're being asked to take the *broad structure* of an idea or relationship and apply it to a **new context**.



### Examples

- "Which of the following would be most similar to ___ as it is described in the passage?"
- "The ___ described in lines 6-7 are most similar to which of the following?"

## Strategies

- **Lose the details:** It’s important to sum up the idea, relationship, or scenario in question in simple, broad terms *before* you try to find a similar situation. Try and say the **big picture** of the situation *in your own words*.

- **Disprove the choices:** Go through the choices one-by-one. For each one, ask yourself—does this choice match the idea, relationship, or scenario that I’m looking for? *The correct choice will be the one you can’t disprove.* If you took the time to say the idea in your own words first, it’s time to trust yourself!



#### Your turn!

**Practice these strategies with the example below!**

EXAMPLE

Whatever their disadvantage with respect to distributing education tax dollars evenly among school districts, in one respect at least, local property taxes are superior to state taxes as a means of funding public schools. Because local property taxes provide public schools with a direct source of revenue, these public schools do not have to compete with other government services for tax dollars. School administrators do not have to compete for a share of the state tax dollars, which are already being spent on health, criminal justice, public safety, and transportation. They are not placed in the position of having to argue that school programs must have priority over other public services financed by state taxes. 

Which of the following would be most similar to the advantage of funding schools with local property taxes as described in the passage?



Choose 1 answer:

- (Choice A)   A small community holds a fundraiser to repair a neglected local road

- (Choice B)   A high school increases its arts budget due to the contribution of a wealthy alumnus

- (Choice C)   A government department receives increased funding due to cuts to other programs

- (Choice D)   An educational research project is subsidized by a government grant

- (Choice E)   Each community center in a wide region receives equal funding from a centralized source

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The correct answer is C

  Explain in detail 

- Choice A: This contradicts information in the passage, which indicates that women were members of temperance and abolitionist societies.
- Choice B: While this might be a true statement, the passage provides no information about the specific views of the women.
- Choice C: This is the best choice. The last sentence states that women formed their own reform societies because they were “denied leadership and the right to speak out” in the societies to which they already belonged.
- Choice D: This might be a true statement, but the passage provides no information about the specific views of the women.
- Choice E: The passage provides no information about the specific views of the women. "Political motives" aren't mentioned.
