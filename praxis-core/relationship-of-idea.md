## How do these ideas relate to one another?

**Relationship of Ideas** questions ask you to spot the relationships between ideas in a passage or a pair of passages. 

**Examples**

- "Which best describes the relationship between Passage 1 and Passage 2?"

- "Which of the following best describes the relationship between the two paragraphs in the passage?"



## Strategies

- **Lose the details.** The specifics don't matter much in these questions, so try describing the ideas in **broad terms**. Do the ideas *contradict*? Does one passage *expand on* the other passage? Predict the relationship **in your own words.**

- Use **process of elimination** to get rid of choices that don't match the relationship you identified.



## Common wrong choices

Wrong choices will sometimes describe the relationship convincingly, but **flip**the roles played by the passages (e.g., say that Passage 1 does something that *Passage 2* actually does). Be sure to double check the passages and make sure you know which one is serving which purpose.



## Your turn!

**Practice these strategies with the example below!**

EXAMPLE

Despite the prevalence of digital books, some researchers have advocated for the continued use of print books over e-readers. Some studies link late-night reading on screens to overall poor health, including lack of sleep and disturbance of circadian rhythms. Other studies have suggested that the human brain may not retain information from a digital screen as well as information read on paper.

But digital books have some major advantages over print books: ease of acquisition and portability. Isn't access to books more important than the medium in which people read? Furthermore, the portability of digital books makes it easier to snatch extra moments of reading throughout the day. The average person wouldn't lug a physical book with them on an errand, but with e-books, it is possible to immerse oneself in Tolstoy while in line at the grocery store.

Which choice best describes the relationship between the two paragraphs in the passage?

Choose 1 answer:

- (Choice A)   The first paragraph introduces a topic about which the second paragraph goes into greater detail.
  
- (Choice B)   The first paragraph offers a point of view that the second paragraph contradicts.
  
- (Choice C)   The first paragraph describes a study while the second paragraph explains why that study was flawed.

- (Choice D)   The first paragraph puts forward a point of view with which the second paragraph agrees, with some reservations.

- (Choice E)   The first paragraph suggests that a topic requires further study while the second paragraph provides the desired information.

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  The correct answer is B

  Explain in detail 

- Choice A: This doesn't describe the relationship between the two paragraphs. The first paragraph does introduce a topic, but the second paragraph doesn't go into a deeper level of detail than the first paragraph does.
- Choice B: This is the best choice. The first paragraph suggests that people should read print books instead of e-books, while the second paragraph offers arguments in favor of e-books.
- Choice C: This isn't the relationship between the passages. Although the first paragraph does refer to studies, the second paragraph doesn't address those studies or suggest that they were flawed.
- Choice D: This doesn't describe the relationship between the passages. The second paragraph does not agree with the first paragraph at all.
- Choice E: This isn't the relationship between the passages. The first paragraph doesn't suggest that the topic of e-book use requires further study; it makes a case for the discontinuation of e-book use.
